= Module 3: Scale vLLM & Compare Performance
:source-highlighter: rouge
:toc: macro
:toclevels: 2

You've measured your single-GPU tail latency baseline: P95 TTFT reaches almost 5000ms under load.
ParasolCloud's customers are frustrated. The obvious solution: add more GPUs to reduce queuing.

In this module, you'll scale to 4 GPUs using naive horizontal scaling,
run the same benchmark, and discover a critical insight:
**more GPUs increase capacity but they can't always fix tail latency**.

== Learning objectives

By the end of this module, you'll be able to:

* Scale vLLM deployment to multiple GPUs with random load balancing
* Run our custom multi-turn benchmark again, using the dashboard controls to compare and contrast
* Demonstrate that naive scaling doesn't reduce the worst of our latency
* Understand why isolated KV caches cause persistent tail latency problems

== Understanding naive scaling

Before deploying, understand what "naive scaling" means:

**Naive horizontal scaling**:

* Deploy multiple independent vLLM instances (1 per GPU)
* Use random load balancing
* Each instance maintains its own isolated KV cache
* No coordination between instances

**What this achieves**:

* ✅ Increases capacity (more requests per second)
* ❌ **Does NOT guarantee reduction in P95/P99 tail latency**

**Why tail latency doesn't improve**:

* **Cache misses persist**: Random routing spreads requests roughly evenly, with no regard for cache
* **Multi-turn conversations**: Conversation turns land on different instances, causing cache misses
* **No coordination**: Instances don't know what other instances have cached

**The critical insight**: Adding GPUs gives you more *capacity* to handle traffic,
but your most frustrated users (P95/P99) still experience high latency because cache
misses cause redundant prefill computation, negating one of vLLM's greatest benefits.

== Exercise 1: Deploy vLLM with 4 replicas

You'll create a single InferenceService configured to scale to 4 replicas,
with each replica running on its own GPU.

=== Clean up single-GPU deployment

First, remove your single-GPU deployment:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
# Delete previous InferenceService
oc delete inferenceservice llama-vllm-single
----

Expected output:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
inferenceservice.serving.kserve.io "llama-vllm-single" deleted
----

=== Deploy scaled vLLM InferenceService

Create an InferenceService with 4 replicas for naive horizontal scaling:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
cat << 'EOF' | oc apply -f-
apiVersion: serving.kserve.io/v1beta1
kind: InferenceService

EOF
----

Expected output:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
inferenceservice.serving.kserve.io/llama-vllm-scaled created

=== Monitor deployment progress

[NOTE]
====
As before, you can follow along in OpenShift AI's dashboard if you like.
====

Watch the InferenceService status:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
# Watch InferenceService status, use Ctrl+C to cancel when it shows ready
oc get inferenceservice llama-vllm-scaled -w
----

Example output:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----

The deployment will progress to `READY` being `True` after the model is loaded. You can press `Ctrl+C` to cancel once it does.
Again, the model and serving runtime should already have been downloaded to your node, so this won't take too long.
The models are being loaded into VRAM, along with CUDA graphs and preallocating KV cache space.

=== Verify the deployment

Check that all 4 replicas are running:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
# Verify 4 pods are running
oc get pods -l serving.kserve.io/inferenceservice=llama-vllm-scaled
----

Example output:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----

Then, check the endpoint to make sure it's behaving:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
# Get the inference URL from the InferenceService
INFERENCE_URL=$(oc get inferenceservice llama-vllm-scaled -o jsonpath='{.status.url}')
# Test the endpoint

----

The endpoint should respond with model information. With 4 replicas, KServe will automatically load balance requests in a random fashion across all instances.

=== Understanding the naive load balancing

With this deployment:

* **KServe automatically load balances** requests across all 4 replicas
* **No session affinity**: Each request can go to any replica
* **Isolated KV caches**: Each replica maintains its own separate cache
* **No cache coordination**: Replicas don't share cache information

This is "naive scaling" - we get 4x capacity, but tail latency won't improve because:

1. Similar requests (with shared system prompts) land on different replicas → cache misses
2. Multi-turn conversations spread across replicas → cache misses frequently
3. Random routing ignores which replica has relevant cached prefixes

Let's benchmark to prove this.

== Exercise 2: Run scaled benchmark

Now run the same benchmark you performed at the end Module 2,
testing our multi-turn scenario to measure tail latency with 4 GPUs.

**Critical question**: Does using 4x GPUs reduce P95/P99 latency?

=== Ensure Grafana metrics are collecting

Make sure that KServe has created your ServiceMonitor

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
oc get servicemonitor llama-vllm-scaled-metrics
----

Example output:

[.console-output]
[source,bash]
----
NAME                        AGE
llama-vllm-scaled-metrics   2m23s
----

=== Access (and configure) your Grafana dashboard

Accessing Grafana again, it may be useful to refresh and explore the `model` pulldown menu.

First, to recover the link again if you've closed the tab:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
# Get Grafana route
route=$(oc get route grafana-route -n grafana -ojsonpath='{.status.ingress[0].host}')
# Output the dashboard link
echo "https://$route/d/llm-performance/llm-d-performance-dashboard"

# Open in browser (URL from command above)
----

You can select the `scaled` model from this pulldown to scope you graph to only the pods for this model.

image::grafana-model-pulldown.png[]

=== Run the benchmark

Run the same benchmark you performed at the end of Module 2, now against the scaled deployment.

Rerun the same benchmark from earlier:

[.console-input]
[source,bash]
----
INFERENCE_URL=$(oc get inferenceservice llama-vllm-scaled -o jsonpath='{.status.url}')

# Run baseline benchmark with sweep profile
cat << EOF | oc apply -f-

WARM-UP PHASE
================================================================================
----

While this runs, observe the Grafana dashboard.

=== Compare results

As our turns start, the KV cache hit rate looks abysmal as none of our conversations have been seen before.
As time goes on, the cache hit rate starts looking pretty high, and our TTFT latencies are, if not great, not horrific looking.
There's some hidden complexity here, though.
When any part of our request has anything in the KV cache, it counts as a KV cache hit. That doesn't mean that our entire prefix or request has been hit,
and many times we will have to recompute large chunks of the prompt anyways.

In the dashboard, you can see P95 and P99 values for the TTFT around 5 seconds as we near the end of the test and the cache get pretty large.
Our benchmark client is reporting in the logs numbers around 25 full seconds per request!

== Exercise 3: Analyze the results

Compare your single-GPU and 4-GPU P95 latency results.
In particular, check out that speedup for later turns when we have four GPUs worth of KV cache available!
It's doing much better this time than before, our instances aren't overloaded.

This time, the benchmark should only take around 5-6 minutes to run, because we're not severely overloading our vLLM instances and dragging the conversations out.

=== Record your comparison

When the benchmark finishes, create a comparison of your results:

[source,text]
----
=== Tail Latency Comparison: 1 GPU vs. 4 GPUs ===

Single GPU (Module 2):
- P95 TTFT: _______

4 GPUs with random load balancing (Module 3):
- P95 TTFT: _______

Improvement: _______ %
----

=== The fundamental problem

**ParasolCloud's Challenge**:

* Fixed hardware budget, the GPUs we're using in production are the GPUs we have
* Customer complaints about slow responses continue
* We can't throw more compute at this problem and hope it goes away

Given the hardware on hand, we have a benchmark that approaches what we're seeing in production.
We're averaging a respectable ~300ms TTFT, but those numbers are over 2000ms for 1/20th of all of our users.

We need to inference smarter.
We have dozens of competing ideas for how to get there, between load balancer optimizations, KV cache offloading with third party appliances, or even a radically different architecture.
We need a well lit path to get there.

=== Visualize the tail latency problem

The key problem is cache isolation causing high P95 latency:

[source,text]
----
Single-turn requests (round-robin/random routing)
------------------------------------------
Request 1: "System prompt... User asks: reset password?"
  → Routes to Replica 1
  → Computes full prefix, caches result

Request 2: "System prompt... User asks: business hours?"
  → Routes to Replica 2 (round-robin/random)
  → Cache miss! Recomputes entire system prompt
  → **Redundant prefill computation**

Request 3: "System prompt... User asks: track order?"
  → Routes to Replica 3
  → Cache miss! Recomputes system prompt again
  → **Another cache miss**

Multi-turn conversation (round-robin/random routing)
---------------------------------------------
Turn 1: "Customer: I have a problem."
  → Routes to Replica 1
  → Computes full context, caches result

Turn 2: "Customer: I have a problem. Agent: ... Customer: Follow-up?"
  → Routes to Replica 3 (round-robin/random)
  → Cache miss! Recomputes entire conversation history
  → **Multi-turn latency spike**

Turn 3: Growing context...
  → Routes to Replica 2
  → Cache miss! Recomputes everything again
  → **Your most frustrated user**
----

**The Solution Needed:**

Intelligent cache-aware routing that:

* Routes similar requests to same replica (cache hits)
* Routes conversation turns to same replica (context reuse)
* Eliminates redundant prefill computation
* **Directly reduces P95/P99 latency**

== Module 3 summary

**What you accomplished:**

* Scaled vLLM deployment from 1 to 4 GPUs with random load balancing
* Ran benchmarks to compare tail latency with more GPUs
* Demonstrated the critical insight: **More GPUs ≠ perfect P95/P99 latency**

**Key takeaways:**

* **Capacity vs. Latency**: 4 GPUs increase throughput (capacity)
* **TTFT still not a good user experience**: We're recomputing a lot of prefill every time
* **Critical insight**: Round-robin/random load balancing + isolated caches = persistent tail latency problems

**The question:**

Can intelligent cache-aware routing dramatically reduce P95/P99 latency without adding more hardware, or rearchitecting our network?

**Next steps:**

Module 4 will deploy the same model, on the same hardware, with llm-d with Precise Prefix Cache Aware Routing.
You'll configure llm-d to orchestrate your 4 vLLM replicas intelligently, routing requests to maximize cache hits and directly reduce P95/P99 latency.
